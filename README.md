# ALU Design Project

## Introduction

This project implements a **parameterized Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** that supports:
- Arithmetic operations (add, sub, inc, dec, etc.)
- Logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, etc.)
- Shift and rotate operations with mode control
- Signed/unsigned arithmetic with overflow detection
- Carry-in handling and comparator outputs

The ALU is designed to be:
- **Synthesizable** for hardware implementation
- **Verifiable** using a modular, self-checking testbench

-  Implement **pipelined execution**, supporting 2 or 3 clock cycle latency based on operation type.
-  Integrate **signed/unsigned arithmetic**, **input validation**, and **error signaling**.
-  Build a **reusable and scalable testbench** with:
  - Driver  
  - Monitor  
  - Scoreboard
-  Validate correctness using a **stimulus-response comparison** mechanism.
-  Generate **automated functional reports** for verification results.

##  Working Methodology

The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is a parameterized Verilog module designed to perform a wide range of arithmetic and logical operations based on input control signals. The module operates in a clocked and pipelined fashion, ensuring proper sequencing of multi-cycle operations. Here's a step-by-step overview of how it works:

1. **Input Latching and Validation**  
   - The ALU accepts operands `OPA` and `OPB`, a command `CMD`, mode `MODE`, and a 2-bit input validity signal `INP_VALID`.
   - Only when valid input combinations are received (e.g., `INP_VALID == 2'b11`), the operation proceeds.

2. **Mode-Based Operation Selection**  
   - The `MODE` signal selects between **Arithmetic** (`MODE = 1`) and **Logical/Shift** (`MODE = 0`) operations.
   - Each operation is identified by a specific command (`CMD`) value.

3. **Operation Decoding & Execution**  
   - Arithmetic operations include: `ADD`, `SUB`, `INC_A`, `DEC_B`, etc.
   - Logical operations include: `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT_A`, etc.
   - Special operations like shift/rotate (`SHL1_A`, `ROR_A_B`) and signed math (`S_UNS_ADD`, `S_UNS_SUB`) are supported.
   - Multiplication operations (`INC1_MUL`, `SHL1_A_MULB`) are executed if enabled.

4. **Pipelining**  
   - A 3-stage pipeline (`VALID_PIPE`) is used to delay and sequence data for multi-cycle operations (e.g., multiplication or comparison).
   - Each valid input progresses through this pipeline until the result is ready.

5. **Result Generation**  
   - The output `RES` holds the final result.
   - Status flags like `OFLOW` (overflow), `COUT` (carry-out), `ERR` (input error), and comparison flags `G`, `L`, `E` are computed based on operation type.

6. **Error Handling**  
   - If the input validity is incorrect or an undefined `CMD` is provided, the ALU sets `ERR = 1` and zeroes the result.


## Future Improvements

- **Expand Operation Set**  
  Add more advanced arithmetic functions such as division, modulus, or floating-point operations using additional `CMD` values.
